## Product Hunt Listing

### Tagline (60 chars max)
"One app for mocks, webhooks, and proxies"

### Description (Draft)
Stop juggling webhook.site, Postman, json-server, and ngrok.

API Dev Studio is a desktop app that combines everything you need to build and test APIs:

- **Mock APIs** - Create endpoints with custom JSON responses in seconds
- **Capture Webhooks** - Get a public URL that tunnels to your local machine
- **Proxy & Record** - Point at a real API and record responses for offline use

It's fast, works offline, and runs natively on your machine. No cloud dependencies, no accounts required.

Free tier available. Pro is a one-time $29 purchase.

### First Comment (Maker Comment) - Draft
Hey everyone! I'm [Name], the maker of API Dev Studio.

I built this because I was tired of having 4 browser tabs open just to test an API integration. webhook.site for catching webhooks, Postman for making requests, json-server for mocks, ngrok for tunneling... it was ridiculous.

So I built one app that does all of it. It's a native desktop app, so it starts instantly and works offline.

I'd love your feedback - especially on what integrations or features would make this more useful for your workflow.

### Media
1. Demo video (45-60 sec) - first position
2. Screenshots showing:
   - Main dashboard
   - Mock endpoint creation
   - Webhook capture view
   - Proxy recording

## Hacker News Post - Draft

**Title:** Show HN: API Dev Studio - One app for mocks, webhooks, and proxies

**Body:**
Hi HN,

I built a desktop app that replaces the handful of tools I was using to test APIs: webhook.site, Postman, json-server, and ngrok.

It does three things:
1. Mock API endpoints with custom responses
2. Capture webhooks locally (with a public URL)
3. Proxy real APIs and record responses

It's a native app, so it starts fast and works offline. No cloud, no accounts.

Free tier: 1 project, 25 endpoints, 100 request history
Pro: $29 one-time for unlimited everything

https://apidevstudio.com

Would love feedback, especially on rough edges or missing features.

## Video Creation

**Recommended tool:** Cap (https://cap.so) - free, open source, adds automatic polish

**Video structure (45-60 seconds):**
1. (0-5s) Problem: Show juggling multiple browser tabs/tools
2. (5-15s) Solution: Open API Dev Studio, show clean UI
3. (15-30s) Demo mock creation: Create endpoint, show response
4. (30-45s) Demo webhook: Get public URL, receive webhook
5. (45-55s) Demo proxy: Point at real API, record response
6. (55-60s) Logo + URL + "Download free"

**Tips:**
- No narration needed (use text overlays)
- Keep it fast-paced
- Show the speed of the app
- End with clear CTA

## Notes

- Hacker News afternoon timing (2-4 PM ET) often works well
- Reddit: Don't post to multiple subreddits simultaneously (looks spammy)
- Respond to EVERY comment on launch day - engagement matters
